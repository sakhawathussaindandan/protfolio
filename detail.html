            I have some strong work experience that will help me with this job if I am successful. I worked for a year
            as a <br> <strong> Data Processing Officer at TCS Pvt Ltd. </strong> That helped me to get confidence in
            talking to the public, and also showed me that this is a job where I will need to work hard.

            A portfolio is a great way to show off your skills to potential employers. And it's especially helpful for
            entry-level developers who might not have any <strong> professional work experience.
            </strong>

            So long as you've built your portfolio website by yourself, it's perfectly fine to include it in your
            projects list. If you tend to change your portfolio design regularly, you can also include previous
            versions.

            When including a project in your portfolio, you're not only showing off your skills, but you're also
            explaining the mindset behind the design. And this is something that potential employers are usually
            interested in.
